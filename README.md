## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learnt how to applu onclick event to my document using only css. I also learnt the importance of pseudo classes, background image placements and how to give the source attribute of an image using css.


```css
#team:target, #upload:target, #password:target, #sub:target, #support:target{
    display: block;
}
#woman{
    ...
    content: url("images/illustration-woman-online-desktop.svg");
}
```

### Continued development
- Linear gradient
- Pseudo classes
- Grid
